## Questions to be asked while choosing a database

Databases now a days have become a problem of plenty. Relational, key-value, document, DHT etc just too many to choose from. With microservices now main stream it is even more important to choose the right database for the right job. 

I have always found this task of choosing the right database a bit dauting. One approach that I always employ is to narrow down on a set of database features that the microservice would need. Since we are talking about a microservice it should be relatively easier to come with such a list.

From time and again I have noticed that the feature set that I have narrowed down on is a subset of questions shared below. Note that this is not a comprehensive questionaire, rather it is meant to act more as checklist to set your tone.
